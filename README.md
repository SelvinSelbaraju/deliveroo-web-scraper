# deliveroo-web-scraper 
The aim of this project is to create a script that scrapes data from Deliveroo. Data is scraped on all restaurants that deliver to the postcode of choice.
### Deliveroo must deliver to your postcode in order for this to work and the postcode must be in the UK

Using this data, the aim is to answer questions like: 
1. What cuisines are most popular near me? 
2. What is the quality of food in my vicinity?
3. How do the qualities of cuisines vary? 
4. Is there a relationship between popularity and quality?
